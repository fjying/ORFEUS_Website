René Carmona, formerly the chair of the department of Operations Research and 
Financial Engineering, is an associate member of the Department of Mathematics, 
a member of the Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics, and 
Director of Graduate Studies of the Bendheim Center for Finance where he 
oversees the Master in Finance program. He obtained a Ph.D. in probability from 
Marseille University where he held his first academic job. 
After time spent at Cornell and Princeton, he moved to the University of 
California-Irvine in 1981, and eventually back to Princeton University in 1995.

Professor Carmona is a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 
of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, 
and of the American Mathematical Society. 
He is the founding chair of the SIAM Activity Group on 
Financial Mathematics and Engineering, a founding editor of the Electronic 
Journal of Probability and Electronic Communications in Probability, 
and the SIAM Journal on Financial Mathematics. 
He is on the editorial board of several peer-reviewed journals and book series.

His publications include over one hundred articles and eleven books in 
probability, statistics, mathematical physics, signal analysis, and financial 
mathematics. He also developed computer programs for teaching and research. 
He has worked on the commodity and energy markets as well as the credit markets, 
and he is recognized as a leading researcher and consultant in these areas. 
Over the last decade his research focused on the development of a probabilistic 
approach to Mean Field Games and Mean Field Control. His two-volume book on the 
subject, co-authored with F. Delarue, was the recipient of the J.L. Doob Prize 
awarded every three years by the American Mathematical Society.

Ronnie Sircar is the Eugene Higgins Professor of Operations Research and 
Financial Engineering (ORFE) at Princeton University, and is affiliated with 
the Bendheim Center for Finance, the Program in Applied and Computational 
Mathematics, and the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment. 
He received his doctorate from Stanford University, and taught for three years 
at the University of Michigan in the Department of Mathematics. His research 
interests center on Financial Mathematics, stochastic volatility models, 
energy markets and exhaustible resources, credit risk, asymptotic 
and computational methods, portfolio optimization and stochastic control problems, 
and stochastic differential games. He is a co-author of the book 
"Multiscale Stochastic Volatility for Equity, Interest-Rate and Credit Derivatives'', 
published by Cambridge University Press in 2011, and was founding co-editor-in-chief 
of the SIAM Journal on Financial Mathematics, from 2009-2015. 
He was made a Fellow of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) 
in 2020 for “contributions to financial mathematics and asymptotic methods for 
stochastic control and differential games”.

Mike Ludkovski is Professor and Chair at the Department of Statistics and 
Applied Probability at University of California Santa Barbara where he has been 
faculty since 2008. He co-directs the UCSB Center for Financial Mathematics and 
Actuarial Research and leads the Simulation and Control in Finance and Insurance 
(SCiFI) Lab. Among his research interests are stochastic modeling, quantitative 
finance, energy markets, and applications of machine learning in longevity and 
non-life insurance. He is a former Chair of the SIAM Activity Group on Financial 
Mathematics and Engineering and was the Co-Chair of the FM'12 and FM'16 conferences.

Ludkovski's research focuses on building statistical emulators for renewable 
energy generation across multiple spatial assets. He has also worked extensively 
on analyzing competitive behavior in energy oligopolies, such as in the context 
of long-term capacity expansion and producers-consumers dynamic equilibrium.
