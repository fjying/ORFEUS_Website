Performance-based Energy Resource Feedback, Optimization, and Risk Management (perform) is a program at Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E). Nowadays, the trade-off between a lower level of reliability - caused by rising renewable penetration - and a more affordable electricity to consumers is being addressed more and more while we mitigate to a zero-emission grid. The main question is are the renewable energies posing any risks to the power grid? perform aims at optimizing the usage of assets in the United States electricity grid by precisely measuring the risks at the asset-level. 

ARPA-E is an agency of the United States' Departments of Energy (DOE) to support and fund advanced researches and technologies in the field of energy.
