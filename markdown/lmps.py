The interactive plot is provided below at this page as a tool to explore how LMPs distribute geographically. 
Please select the day and hour to look at LMPs distribution at the particular hour.

* Each bus is labelled as the dot, with the size and the warmness of the dot proportional to the magnitude of LMP. 
* The buses with the negative prices are emphasized as the largest size dots.
* The congested transmission lines with over 98% line capacities used are plotted as the red segments if existed.

The interactive features of the plot allow the users to do the following:
* Drag the mouse to any region of interest and Use the scroll wheel of mouse to zoom in to further explore the region with more map details 
* Hover on the dots representing the buses to view the information including Bus Name, LMP, and Demand 
* Hover on the red segments representing the congested lines to view the information including Line ID, Congestion Ratio, and Connected Bus IDs
* Hover on the upper right side of the plot until the buttons show to utilize the functionalities including zoom in, zoom out, and reset
* Click the legends on the right side of the plot to unselect and select the information specific to the legends

Simulation of Real-world Power Grid Operations 
    to Generate Realistic Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs) to 
    Reflect the Balance between Supply and Demand 
    at Each Bus 

* Use Texas 7k Grid with a Rich Set of Generators of Various Types 
including Renewables
* Run Unit Commitment and Economic Dispatch through Advanced Optimization
* Calculate LMPs to Reflect the Balance of Supply and Demand

We design and develop the software Vatic to efficiently simulate the grid operations
and the software could be customized to any grid.
