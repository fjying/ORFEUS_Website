Renewable energy resources reduce carbon footprint and marginal cost, but also introduce risk to the grid that is not fully accounted 
for under current operational paradigms. The ORFEUS platform is a set of asset-specific modules which calibrate 
stochastic models of the joint behavior of forecasted and actual production, tailored to wind, solar and load. 
Models are linked through a high-dimensional correlation constructor which renders spatial and temporal correlation structure 
tractable via LASSO-based methods and parametric representations of locational correlation structure.
